**Candidate: Hasan Mahmud**  
*Based on Resume & Experience at Penciltech, Shell Technologies, Wafi Solutions*

---

## 1. Tell me about yourself and your DevOps journey.

**Answer:**  
I'm Hasan Mahmud, a DevOps & Cloud Engineer with over a decade of experience in software development and infrastructure automation. I started as a Software Engineer, working extensively with C#, ASP.NET, and Angular, which gave me a strong full-stack foundation. Over time, I transitioned into DevOps, focusing on cloud platforms, CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and infrastructure as code.

In my current role at **Penciltech**, I’ve led the migration of a SaaS platform from VPS to AWS, implemented Docker and Ansible for consistent deployments, automated SSL renewals, and set up observability with Grafana and Loki. I’ve also built robust CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and Jenkins. My blend of development and operations experience allows me to bridge gaps between teams and deliver scalable, reliable systems.

---

## 2. You mentioned migrating a SaaS platform from VPS to AWS. Can you walk me through that process?

**Answer:**  
Yes. At Penciltech, we were running a SaaS application on traditional VPS environments, which lacked scalability and high availability. To modernize the infrastructure, I led the migration to **AWS**, using:

- **EC2** for compute instances with auto-scaling groups for elasticity.
- **RDS (MySQL)** for managed, highly available databases with automated backups and snapshots.
- **S3** for secure, durable storage of user uploads and static assets.

I used **Terraform** to define the infrastructure as code, ensuring reproducibility across environments. I also **Dockerized** the application services to ensure consistency between development and production. The migration improved system scalability, reduced downtime, and enabled faster deployment cycles.

---

## 3. How did you ensure consistency in deployments? What tools did you use?

**Answer:**  
To ensure consistent deployments, I leveraged **Docker** and **Ansible** together:

- I **containerized** the application services using Docker, which encapsulated dependencies and environment configurations.
- I wrote **Ansible playbooks** to automate server provisioning, Nginx configuration, and Docker service deployment.
- This combination allowed us to achieve **repeatable, idempotent deployments** across staging and production environments, reducing configuration drift and human error.

Additionally, all deployment workflows were triggered via **CI/CD pipelines** in GitHub Actions, further minimizing manual intervention.

---

## 4. How did you automate SSL certificate renewals in Docker?

**Answer:**  
We were using **Nginx as a reverse proxy** in Docker containers with Let’s Encrypt SSL certificates. The challenge was preventing certificate expiry during container restarts or redeployments.

To solve this:
- I wrote a **Bash script** that checks the certificate expiry date using `openssl`.
- If the certificate is within 30 days of expiry, it triggers `certbot` to renew it.
- This script is scheduled via **cron inside the container**, running daily.
- The renewed certificates are automatically reloaded in Nginx using `nginx -s reload`.

This automation eliminated manual renewal tasks and prevented any service disruption due to expired certificates.

---

## 5. Describe your CI/CD pipeline setup using GitHub Actions.

**Answer:**  
At Penciltech, I designed and maintained **GitHub Actions pipelines** to automate testing, building, and deployment.

The pipeline includes:
- **Trigger:** On push to `develop` (deploy to staging) and `main` (deploy to production).
- **Jobs:**
  - Run unit and integration tests.
  - Build Docker images with proper tagging (e.g., commit SHA).
  - Push images to a private ECR registry.
  - SSH into the target server (or use Ansible) to pull the new image and restart services.
- I also established **Git branching strategies** (e.g., feature branches, PR reviews) to reduce release errors and improve code quality.

This setup reduced deployment time from hours to minutes and improved release reliability.

---

## 6. You used Grafana Loki. Why did you choose it, and how did it help?

**Answer:**  
We needed a lightweight, scalable solution for **centralized log aggregation** to troubleshoot application and Nginx issues faster.

I chose **Grafana Loki** because:
- It’s cost-effective (indexes only metadata, not full logs).
- Integrates seamlessly with **Prometheus and Grafana**.
- Works well with Docker and structured logging.

I configured Docker’s logging driver to send logs to Loki using **Promtail**. Once set up, teams could:
- Search logs across services in real time.
- Correlate logs with metrics in Grafana dashboards.
- Identify errors quickly (e.g., 5xx responses in Nginx).

This reduced mean time to resolution (MTTR) significantly.

---

## 7. How do you manage infrastructure as code? Which tools do you use?

**Answer:**  
I use **Terraform** as the primary IaC tool for provisioning cloud resources on AWS. For example:
- Defined VPCs, subnets, security groups, EC2 instances, RDS, and S3 buckets in `.tf` files.
- Used **remote state storage in S3 with DynamoDB locking** to enable team collaboration and prevent conflicts.
- Applied `terraform plan` and `apply` in CI/CD pipelines with proper approvals.

For configuration management, I use **Ansible** to:
- Install and configure software (e.g., Docker, Nginx).
- Deploy applications and manage secrets.

This combination ensures infrastructure is **version-controlled, auditable, and reproducible**.

---

## 8. What monitoring and observability tools have you worked with?

**Answer:**  
I’ve worked with a full observability stack:
- **Prometheus**: For scraping and storing metrics from Docker, Node Exporter, and applications.
- **Grafana**: To visualize metrics (CPU, memory, request rates) and create dashboards for uptime and performance.
- **Loki**: For log aggregation from Docker and Nginx.
- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**: Previously used at other roles for structured log analysis.

I also set up **alerting rules in Prometheus** (e.g., high error rates, disk pressure) and routed them to Slack or email via Alertmanager.

---

## 9. You have strong full-stack experience. How does that help in your DevOps role?

**Answer:**  
My background as a **Senior Software Engineer** in ASP.NET, Angular, and cloud services gives me a unique advantage:

- I can **collaborate effectively with developers**—I understand their pain points, logging practices, and application architecture.
- I can **optimize CI/CD pipelines** based on the app’s tech stack (e.g., .NET build steps, Angular bundling).
- I can **troubleshoot issues faster** because I understand both code and infrastructure layers.
- I’ve even contributed to application code (e.g., adding health checks, structured logging) to make systems more observable and cloud-native.

This full-stack insight helps me design DevOps solutions that are practical, efficient, and developer-friendly.

---

## 10. Have you worked with Kubernetes? If so, describe your experience.

**Answer:**  
Yes, I have hands-on experience with **Kubernetes** in test and staging environments.

I’ve:
- Deployed containerized applications on **EKS** and **Minikube**.
- Written manifests for Deployments, Services, Ingress, and ConfigMaps.
- Used **Helm** for templating and managing application releases.
- Integrated Kubernetes with **Argo CD** for GitOps-style continuous delivery.

While my current role uses Docker Compose for now, I’ve advocated for Kubernetes adoption to improve scalability and resilience, especially as the SaaS platform grows.

---

## 11. What is GitOps, and have you used Argo CD?

**Answer:**  
**GitOps** is a methodology where the desired state of infrastructure and applications is stored in Git, and automated tools ensure the system matches that state.

I’ve used **Argo CD** as a GitOps tool to:
- Sync Kubernetes applications from a Git repository automatically.
- Provide a dashboard for deployment status and rollback capabilities.
- Enable declarative, auditable, and automated deployments.

At Penciltech, I’ve started exploring Argo CD for future container orchestration, aiming to reduce manual deployments and improve rollback safety.

---

## 12. How do you handle database migrations in CI/CD?

**Answer:**  
Although not explicitly in my current role, in past full-stack projects (e.g., Pension Portal, Recruitment System), I handled database migrations using:

- **Entity Framework Core Migrations** in .NET apps.
- Scripts were version-controlled and applied via CI/CD after deployment.
- For production, I used a **manual approval step** in the pipeline to execute migrations safely.
- Backups were taken before applying changes.

In DevOps contexts, I’d integrate tools like **Liquibase** or **Flyway** for database versioning, especially in microservices environments.

---

## 13. How do you ensure security in your DevOps practices?

**Answer:**  
Security is integrated into every layer:
- **Secrets Management**: Used AWS SSM Parameter Store and environment variables (not hardcoded).
- **IAM Roles & Policies**: Applied least privilege access for EC2 and services.
- **Secure CI/CD**: Protected main branches, required PR reviews, scanned code for vulnerabilities.
- **Container Security**: Scanned Docker images using tools like Trivy in pipelines.
- **Network Security**: Configured security groups, private subnets, and WAF where needed.
- **Compliance**: Followed best practices for data encryption (at rest and in transit).

In previous roles, I also worked on **cybersecurity dashboards**, giving me deeper insight into security monitoring.

---

## 14. Describe a challenge you faced in DevOps and how you solved it.

**Answer:**  
One challenge was **frequent deployment failures due to environment inconsistency**.

Developers tested locally, but apps failed in staging due to config differences.

**Solution:**
- I **Dockerized** all services, ensuring the same environment everywhere.
- Used **Ansible** to automate configuration.
- Introduced **GitHub Actions** with automated testing and staging deployments.

Result: Deployment success rate improved from ~70% to 99%, and troubleshooting time dropped significantly.

---

## 15. Where do you see yourself in 3–5 years?

**Answer:**  
I aim to grow into a **Senior DevOps or Cloud Architect** role, leading cloud transformation initiatives and mentoring junior engineers. I want to deepen my expertise in **Kubernetes, serverless, and FinOps**, and contribute to building resilient, cost-efficient, and automated cloud platforms. I’m also passionate about **GitOps and platform engineering**, and I’d like to help build internal developer platforms that empower teams to ship faster and safer.

---

## 16. Can you describe the architecture of the Laravel application you deployed at Penciltech? 

**Answer:**  
Yes. The SaaS application at Penciltech is built with **Laravel (PHP)** and hosted on **AWS**, migrated from VPS to a scalable, containerized setup. The core components include:

- **Docker** containers for `nginx` (reverse proxy) and `php-fpm` (PHP processing).
- **Docker Compose** to orchestrate services locally and in production.
- **AWS EC2** for container hosting, **RDS (MySQL)** for managed database, and **S3** for secure file storage.
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD, with pipelines triggering builds and deployments.
- **Grafana Loki** for centralized logging of Laravel and Nginx logs.

This architecture ensures consistency across environments, improves scalability, and enables rapid, reliable deployments.

## 🔹 17. Walk me through how your SSL renewal script works.

**Answer:**  
At Penciltech, I built a fully automated SSL renewal system for our Dockerized Laravel app behind Nginx. Here’s how it works:

1. **Discover Domains**:  
   The script scans `/etc/letsencrypt/live/` to find all domains with existing certs — no hardcoding needed.

2. **Prepare Volumes**:  
   Ensures each domain has a directory in `/home/rdssl`, which is mounted into the Nginx container.

3. **Stop Nginx**:  
   Temporarily stops the `webserver` container to free port 80 for Certbot’s `--standalone` mode.

4. **Renew Certs**:  
   Runs `certbot renew --standalone`, which automatically renews any cert within 30 days of expiry.

5. **Restart & Stabilize**:  
   Starts the container and waits up to 60 seconds to confirm it’s running.

6. **Copy & Reload**:  
   Copies renewed `fullchain.pem` and `privkey.pem` to `/home/rdssl/domain/`, sets secure permissions, then reloads Nginx gracefully with `nginx -s reload`.

It runs twice daily via cron and has eliminated all SSL expiry incidents.

---

## 🔹 18. Why do you stop and start the Nginx container instead of using `--webroot`?

**Answer:**  
I chose `--standalone` over `--webroot` for **simplicity and reliability** in our Docker setup.

- With `--webroot`, Nginx must serve ACME challenges from `.well-known/`. This requires:
  - Extra config in Nginx.
  - Risk of misconfiguration or routing conflicts.
  - Challenge files must be accessible during renewal.

- With `--standalone`, Certbot runs its own lightweight server on port 80 — **no Nginx involvement**.

Yes, it requires a brief stop of Nginx (~10 seconds), but since renewal only happens every ~60 days and we run it off-peak, the minimal downtime is acceptable.

For high-availability systems, I’d consider `--webroot` or load-balanced setups — but for single-server Docker, `--standalone` is cleaner and more reliable.

---

## 🔹 19. Why not mount `/etc/letsencrypt` directly into the Nginx container?

**Answer:**  
Great question — this is a **security and operational best practice**.

Mounting `/etc/letsencrypt` directly would expose:
- Private keys (`privkey.pem`)
- Account private keys
- Full certificate chain history

This increases the **attack surface** if the container is compromised.

Instead, I use a **secure copy pattern**:
1. Certbot manages certs on the **host** (`/etc/letsencrypt`).
2. After renewal, only the **latest `fullchain.pem` and `privkey.pem`** are copied to `/home/rdssl/domain/`.
3. `/home/rdssl` is the **only volume mounted** into the container.

This follows the **principle of least privilege** — the container gets only what it needs.

---

## 🔹 20 How do you ensure the Nginx container restarts successfully?

**Answer:**  
I built in **resilience and recovery**:

- After `docker compose start`, I call `wait_for_stable_container()` — a loop that checks container status every second for up to 60 seconds.
- If the container doesn’t become “running”, it triggers `handle_error()`.
- `handle_error()` logs the issue and attempts a `docker compose restart` to recover.
- All actions are logged to `/var/log/ssl-renewal.log` for audit and debugging.

This ensures the system **self-heals** from transient failures — like slow startup due to high load or disk I/O.

---

## 🔹 21. How does the script handle multiple domains?

**Answer:**  
The script is **fully dynamic and domain-agnostic**:

- It uses `discover_domains()` to scan `/etc/letsencrypt/live/` and build a list of domains.
- For each domain, it ensures a directory exists in `/home/rdssl/`.
- During renewal, Certbot renews **all eligible certs** in one run.
- After renewal, it loops through each domain and copies the updated certs.

So when a new domain is added:
1. Run `certbot certonly --standalone -d newdomain.com` once.
2. The script **automatically detects it** on the next run.
3. No code or config changes needed.

This makes the system **scalable and low-maintenance**.

---

## 🔹 22. What happens if Certbot fails to renew a certificate?

**Answer:**  
The script handles failures gracefully:

- It captures `certbot` exit code in `RENEWAL_RESULT`.
- If non-zero, it **logs the error** but still starts the Nginx container to restore service.
- It does **not** attempt to copy or reload certs — avoids applying partial/incomplete updates.
- The error is logged, and the system will retry in 12 hours.

Since Let’s Encrypt allows ~5 failed attempts per week, temporary failures (e.g., network issues) are safe. I also monitor logs and get alerts if renewal fails repeatedly.

---

## 🔹 23. Why do you reload Nginx instead of restarting it?

**Answer:**  
Because `nginx -s reload` performs a **graceful reload**:

- New worker processes start with the updated SSL certs.
- Old workers continue serving existing connections until they complete.
- **No dropped connections or downtime**.

A full `restart` would briefly interrupt active sessions — not acceptable for a production SaaS platform.

So after copying the new certs, I run:

```bash
docker compose exec webserver nginx -s reload
```
---

## 🔹 24. Describe the Laravel application architecture.

**Answer:**
The core architecture is containerized and service-oriented, leveraging Docker for consistency and AWS for managed services. 

Here’s a breakdown of the key components: 

   1. Frontend & Application Layer (Dockerized): 
       - The Laravel application runs within a Docker container using PHP-FPM.
       - It is served by an Nginx container acting as a reverse proxy and web server, handling HTTP/HTTPS traffic and static assets.
       - These two services are orchestrated together using Docker Compose on an AWS EC2 instance, ensuring the application environment is consistent and reproducible.
         

   2. Database Layer (AWS RDS): 
        - Instead of a self-managed MySQL container, I migrated the database to Amazon RDS (MySQL).
        - This provides high availability (with Multi-AZ deployment), automated backups, point-in-time recovery, and managed patching, significantly improving data reliability and reducing operational overhead.
         

   3. Storage Layer (AWS S3): 
       - User-uploaded files and static assets are stored in Amazon S3.
       - This provides a highly durable, scalable, and secure object storage solution, decoupling storage from the application servers.
         
     
    4. Caching & Queue Processing: 
        - Redis is used for caching (e.g., config, routes) and as a queue driver to handle background jobs like sending emails or processing data, improving application performance and responsiveness.
         

   5. CI/CD & Automation: 
       - I established CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions to automate the build, test, and deployment process.
       - Ansible playbooks are used to provision and configure the EC2 servers, ensuring infrastructure consistency.
       - Terraform is used to define the core AWS infrastructure (VPC, EC2, RDS, S3) as code.
         

    6. Security & Observability: 
        - SSL/TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt are automated using a custom Bash script and cron on the host, which stops the Nginx container, renews the certs, and restarts it, preventing any expiry incidents.
        - For monitoring and troubleshooting, I deployed Grafana Loki to aggregate logs from both the Laravel application and Nginx, enabling real-time log searching and faster issue resolution.
        - Secrets like database credentials are managed securely using AWS SSM Parameter Store.
              
In summary, the architecture is a modern, cloud-optimized setup: a Dockerized Laravel app on EC2 talking to managed services (RDS, S3), with automated deployments (GitHub Actions, Ansible) and centralized logging (Loki), all designed for scalability, reliability, and ease of maintenance.
